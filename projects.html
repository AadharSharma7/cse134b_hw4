                <!-- <p> 
                    Birds of a Feather is an android application. This app was made in a group of 6, including me.
                    The goal of the app was to help students find other students in their current class that they share classes with.
                    The app is easy to use. If it is your first time logging in, then you enter your information, such as name, profile picture,
                    and all your classes that you have either taken in the past or are currenlty taken. After the login step is completed, 
                    you can check to see if you share or did share other classes with your current classmates. To check this, simply tap on the
                    start icon, this will use bluetooth to connect with students within 30-40 feet, and will show the user the name of 
                    their fellow students if they share atleast one class together, and it will also show the user how many classes they share 
                    with their fellow students. The user can then click on one of the students they connected with to see more details about that
                    specific studnet. The user also has an option to wave to that student and that student can wave back to them.

                <!-- <p> In a team of two, including me, we built a Operating System simular to help us better understand how an Operating System 
                    functions. Implemented important functions of an operating system such as: timer interrupt, thread synchronization, and thread joining.
                    Developed a memory management system with demand paging for virtual and physical memory to support multiprogramming.
                    Created system calls for file management such as: open, create, read, write, close, unlink, execute. Overall, our Operating System
                    functioned as expected.

                <!-- <p> 
                    The goal for this project was to build convolutional neural networks to classify images of food belonging to one of twenty different categories. 
                    The CNNs were built using convolution layers, max pooling, adaptive average pooling, fully connected layers, and regularization techniques such as drop out. 
                    More specifically, a convolutional neural network was trained to recognize pictures of food ranging from garlic bread to cheesecake and chocolate cake. 
                    The problem was that given pictures of similarly shaped/colored food (like cheesecake and chocolate cake) it can be hard to distinguish between the two categories.
                    Using a basic CNN architecture, our baseline CNN model was able to get an accuracy of around 45%. 
                    After improving the baseline model, our custom CNN model was able to get an accuracy of around 56%. 
                    Using transfer learning to train resnet18 and vgg16, we were able to get accuracies of around 80% and 79% respectively.

                <!-- <p> 
                    Developed a multiplayer chess game in python. The main library that was used for this game was pygame. After using pygame
                    to build a few simple games I tried to make chess from scratch. Using the knowledge I built by working with pygame,
                    I was able to create a functioning chess game within a week or so. There are still some actual chess moves that cannot
                    be performed in this game such as the castle, however, overall the game mimics real life chess. This was a personal project.

            <h2> Future Projects Plans </h2>
            <p>
                One plan for the future that I have is to extend the chess game that I made and add an AI to it. This way
                the user can simple play against the computer and do not need another person to play with. I would also like to add castling in the 
                chess game. Another idea that I have is to build a website to keep track of exactly what I eat throughout the day, and also
                keep track of what I should be eating throughout the day. I think this site would be mostly beneficial for myself and it could
                also come in handy for other people.
